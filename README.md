# What is LLM Tools?

This is a Github org to host all the open source libraries me and my other open source contributors will be publishing in the LLM / Embeddings space. Currently there is the [EmbedJs](https://github.com/llm-tools/embedjs) which is a simple and powerful way to create an LLM powered bot over any data.

Please consider giving the libraries a `star` if you like them :)
