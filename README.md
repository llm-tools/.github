# What is LLMEmbed?

This is a Github org to host all the open source libraries I want to and will be publishing in the LLM / Embeddings space. Currently there is the [EmbedJs](https://github.com/llmembed/embedjs) which is a simple and powerful way to create an LLM powered bot over any data. 

My current area of focus is in embedding structured data (like from a SQL Server) in a scaleable way. There are many open research topics here and it may take some time. Feel free to contribute anywhere by sending in issues / PR - this will help add value to others, just like these libraries might have added value to you. If you want to become a core maintainer of any of the libraries, reach out to me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adhityan/).

Lastly, please consider giving the libraries a `star` if you like them :)
